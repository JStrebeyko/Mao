# Mao's Simple Chinese

Here's my first React (and front-end in general) project! Just wanted to have these huge _hanzi_ displayed full screen. Click Mao Zedong's head for the app to `.fetch()` some little Chinese language lessons!

## Getting Started

It is enough to just clone it and see it fly using the `start` script. Just hit the head up for next lesson!

## Built with

React.js, Webpack, CSS

## TODO

[ ] hanzi styling panel / randomizer
